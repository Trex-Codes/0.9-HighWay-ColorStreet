# 0.9-HighWay-ColorStreet
## Canva road through canvas with the option to change colors to each part of the canva

## Starting üé®	
_This project works with similarities as in [0.11-Nodes-Colors-Change](https://github.com/Trex-Codes/0.11-Nodes-Colors-Change), which generates divs that contain colored boxes.
These allow to modify the colors of each element **(mountains, sun, road, sky)**_

## Deployment üîå
_There are 5 buttons **(Color Sun, Color Mountains, Color Highway, Color Lines Highway)** which, through `JS Onclick () events`, allow generating a div (color palette) that changes the color with each element.
Also with a button that allows hiding the color palettes for better visualization. They are the same project but it varies with how the program changes the colors_

1. **Buttons_RectsColors**
_The branch comprises by means of **btns** that are generated by means of functions in `JS`, then each div (palette) shows the colors available to change each element of the canva_
